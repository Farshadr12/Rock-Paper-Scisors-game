# Rock papger scisors game

Rock paper scissors is a classic game that can be played with two or more players. 
Each player chooses one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. 
The rules are simple: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, 
and paper beats rock. If both players choose the same option, it is a tie and they play again. 
To make a rock paper scissors game with Python language, 
we can use the random module to generate a random choice for the computer player, 
and the input function to get the userâ€™s choice. We can then compare the choices using 
conditional statements and print the result. We can also use a loop to repeat the game until the user wants to quit.
